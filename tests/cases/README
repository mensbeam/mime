The MimeType class is an original work, but its test suite is derived
in part from an existing test corpus from the following source:

The Web Platform Test suite 
    <https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/62317fb983ca5687e4133d89f5523839fdab7f69/mimesniff/mime-types>

The license text is reproduced below, but please note that the license text 
has changed since the last time the mimesniff portion of the test suite was
modified; the text included here is current as of 2019-04-25.
